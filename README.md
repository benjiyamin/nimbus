# Project Nimbus

Nimbus is an open-source library written in Python for performing hydrology simulations and routing. 
Most of the calculations and procedures are derived from available existing publications and resources. 
There are many GUI programs available that have similar capabilities. This foundation from Nimbus is 
created with the intent that engineers will build from and contribute to the project, making it much 
more powerful than I alone ever could.
